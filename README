NAME

Authen::Passphrase - hashed passwords/passphrases as objects

DESCRIPTION

This is the base class for a system of objects that encapsulate
passphrases.  An object of this type is a passphrase recogniser: its
job is to recognise whether an offered passphrase is the right one.
For security, such passphrase recognisers usually do not themselves know
the passphrase they are looking for; they can merely recognise it when
they see it.  There are many schemes in use to achieve this effect,
and the intent of this class is to provide a consistent interface to
them all, hiding the details.

The CPAN package Authen::Passphrase contains implementations of several
specific passphrase schemes in addition to the base class.
